# FullStack-React-DLDNewsMag
This is a fullstack app built with React, Java, and Javascript (group project).


This project was a group effort built with David Telfer and Drew Neillie while in our last weeks at CodeClan Glasgow. We took inspiration from several news magazines including Slate, The Atlantic, The New Yorker, and Wired, and created our own version.
